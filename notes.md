--What is TypeScript?
=>

1. TypeScript is a superset of javaScript.
2. TypeScript is javaScript with types.
3. TypeScript is a strongly typed programming language.
4. Its created by Microsoft.

-- Where does typeScript run?
=>
TypeScript code converts to javaScript, which run anywhere javaScript runs: In a browser, on Node.js or Deno and in your apps. It has TypeScript compiler(tsc) who compiles typeScript to vanilla javaScript.

-- Why We use TypeScript?
=>

1. JavaScript is not suitable for larger application. TypeScript reduces human errors during Development phase.

2. JavaScript is a weird language. 1\* "10" => 10, undefined + 14 => NaN but in typeScript we got proper error.

3. In javaScript we get only errors in our browser console but we can get proper errors in development phase in our code editors by using typeScript.

4. TypeScript has strong static type Checking.

5. TypeScript gives us Best intelligence support in our code editors.

6. Added new features like interfaces, Tuples, Enums, Generics.

7. Better object oriented programming (OOP) experiences.

8. TypeScript supports es6 features.

9. TypeScript compiled to vanilla javaScript, so it can run older browser also.
